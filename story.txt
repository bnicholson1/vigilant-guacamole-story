There once was a guy in college. His name is Bradley. One day he was walking to class and he tripped and fell.

As he lay on the ground in agony, his vision started going black. The shooting pain in his leg was unbearable
causing him to writhe in pain. All his life's regrets and mistakes began flashing through his life. Was this
really the end? Was Bradley truly about to succumb to the sidewalk?

He tried to get up straight, but there was no one around to help him.

Suddenly, out of no where a man in a black jacket ran up to young Bradley. The man quickly picked Bradley up, slung him over his shoulder and boooked it to
the nearest hospital. As soon as he got there the nurses ran up to him and wheeled Bradley away on a stretcher. The nurse told the man that they don't know
if Bradley will make it or not.
